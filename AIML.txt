Data is a information in wich we cannt do anything with out data

1.Deep learning
2.Machine learning
3.Artificial intligence

Deep learning means in which it learning's data again and  again ,that means it will update that data day by data 

 Machine learning means

types 3
1.supereeed --> both independent and dependent
2.unsupered -->only features are available
3.semisupered --> only some part is lable 

to do project
1.data collection 
2.data understanding
3.data visulization (graphs)
4.data pre-processing (in the form of numbers,it does not like or take strings (removing unwanted errors or rows or columns))
      to figure out the unwanted errors in the given data
      converting a raw data into a proper data
5.model building  (at this point it will start learing)
6.moddel evaluation   (75if we want more we will again move to data pre-processing)
7.result

1,2,3,4 are data analysis 5,6,7   are ML-->DA+ML

to done a project in machine learning in P
1.NUMPY
2.
3.PANDA'S (file text(to exctract
4.SKLERS
5.


pip install pandas

3 types of business pro's:
1.classification --> categories (yes no,pass fail,paid notpaid----)
2.regression -->continous numbers
3.clustering

1,2 are supervised   3 is unsupervised
           
algorithm means to find the parameter points  from the given data which is mathemetically given 

types of algorithm
1.k nearest neighbours (it is a open source algorithm)
 It will calculate the distance 				
 Equalean formula i.e.,distance b/w two points
      x1   y1 y
1 -  1     1   t        5 to 1 sqrt (4-1)^2+(3-1)^2=sqrt(9+4)=sqrt(13)=3.5
2  - 2    2    t        5 to 2 sqrt(4-2)^2+(3-2)^2=sqrt(5)=2.1
3  -  2    3    f       5 to 3 sqrt(4-2)^2+(3-3)^2=sqrt(4)=2
4  -  3    4    f       5 to 4=sqrt(4-3)^2+(3-4)^2=sqrt(2)=1.4
5  - 4     3   t,f

k=1 4 f
k=2 43 ff  f
k=3 432 fft f
k=4 4321 fftt
it is a binary classification 
2 way class avoids 2 

advatange of k is 
open box
any data set
disadvatange of k is
time complixety

it is difficult to find correct value 
the picking up of k value is neutral (trial )

first random 80per for trinaing
second 20per testing

Y(test)  Y(train)
  t                t           t
  t                f           f
  f                t           f
  f                f           f

If the data in the binary numbers
p = 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  0
q = 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1

S/(MC = (M11+M00)/(M01+M10+M11+M00) = (0+7)/(2+1+0+7) = 0.7
J = (M11)/(M01+M10+M11) = 

Hamming Distance:
The Hamming Distance Between
Same lenght
Both are distance are at differnet
1."Karolin" and "Kathrin" is 3
2."Karolin" and "Kerstin" is 3
3.1011101 and 1001001 is 2
4.2173896 and 2233796 is 2
